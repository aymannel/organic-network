## overall aims
1. Interactive network map depicting relationship between most commonly used organic reactions.
2. Overlay 'chemical' nodes showing which reagents are associated with which reactions.
3. Each node (reaction mechanism) serves as a revision resource.
4. Each node contains an Anki tag so that card scheduling can be done from Obsidian.
5. Scrape organic-chemistry.org to create network.
